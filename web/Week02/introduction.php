<h1>Tyson's Homepage</h1>
<h3>Hello, my name is Tyson Doberneck. I am majoring in Software Engineering and have a year until I graduate. I am originally from
Galt, CA and I served my mission in the Florida, Tallahassee Mission. My wife and I are expecting our first child mid July and we could
not be more terrified and excited for anything in our lives. I love to kayak, rock climb and play retro video games in my spare time.</h3>
